# Secure Web App
### Enterprise Web Development Security Assignment

This is a simple web app that was required for Step 2 (a) of the Security Assignment of EWD, and was created on 02nd February 2021.
Ã‰amonn DeLeaster's Donation app from the EWD module was used as a starter template for this app, which was simplified down.
It was initially created with the intention of demonstrating how security authentication works when logging in, or registering to a web application.
However, it was further expanded in functionality to demonstrate many other common security features, as outlined in the Report, which is located in this repository.
